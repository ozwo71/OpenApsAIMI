 * to is the name between the level and the colon.
 *
 * Two rules shape this class:
 *
 * - The file can be five megabytes. It is never read whole. Only the last [TAIL_BYTES] are read,
 *   and only the last [MAX_LINES] kept lines are handed back, so the screen stays cheap to open
 *   even while a session is writing.
 * - A failure line written with a cause carries its stack trace on the lines that follow, and
 *   those lines have no prefix of their own. They are kept with the line they belong to, because
 *   a stack trace with its first line missing is the one thing nobody can read.
