     * on the dashboard, and the calibration plugin, which refuses to fit anything without a session
     * to fit it in. [Libre3SensorChange] holds the rule and keeps it unique per sensor; this method
     * only carries it out. It follows [BooleanKey.BgSourceCreateSensorChange], like every other
     * source, and the check comes first so switching the setting on later still writes the event.
     *
     * Called on every accepted reading as well as after a scan, so a sensor that was started by an
     * older build is repaired by itself. The database refuses a second event with the same moment,
     * so the worst a repeat can cost is one insert that changes nothing.
     *
     * @param activatedAtMs when the sensor was started, in phone time; zero when it is not known.
     * @param owner the watcher of the sensor this activation time belongs to. A sensor swap while
     *   this call was queued would otherwise date the **new** sensor's start on the **old** one's
     *   activation, because by then the stored serial is already the new one and the "already
     *   written" mark is already gone. The sensor age and the calibration session would then both
     *   be wrong by a whole sensor life.
