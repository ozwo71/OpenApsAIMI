/**
 * Decides when the Libre 3 source has to write a `SENSOR_CHANGE` therapy event.
 *
 * The event matters far beyond the sensor age shown on the dashboard: it is the only mark that
 * tells the rest of AAPS where one sensor stops and the next one starts. The calibration plugin
 * refuses to work without it, because a fit that ran across two sensors would mix two different
 * biases into one line.
 *
 * The rule is one event per sensor. A sensor is named by its serial number, so re-scanning or
 * re-connecting the same sensor never writes a second event and never makes a running sensor look
 * new. The decision is kept here, apart from the store and from the plugin, so it can be read and
 * tested on its own.

     *   was written yet.

     * @param activatedAtMs when that sensor was started, in phone time. Zero means the start is
     *   not known; an event at that time would land in 1970 and make the sensor look endlessly old.
     * @param nowMs the phone clock. A start in the future can only come from a wrong clock or a
     *   bad read, and must never reach the database.
