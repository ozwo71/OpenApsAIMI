/**
 * Pure rules behind "correct the insertion date" on the ONE+ Status screen.
 *
 * The sensor age of this source comes from the driver's own stored session start, not from the
 * `SENSOR_CHANGE` therapy event, and that clock is written once — at pairing, or at the first
 * reading. A sensor inserted hours before it was paired therefore carried a wrong age for its whole
 * life, and nothing in the app could move it: adding a `SENSOR_CHANGE` by hand does not reach this
 * clock, and an added event that is EARLIER than the one the plugin already wrote is not even the
 * "last sensor change" any more, so the dashboard ignores it too.
