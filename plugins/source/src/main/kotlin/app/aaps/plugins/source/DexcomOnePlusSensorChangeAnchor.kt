/**
 * Pure decision behind the ONE+ SENSOR_CHANGE anchor: should the plugin's own auto timestamp
 * (pairing moment, or first accepted reading) be replaced by a SENSOR_CHANGE the user already
 * logged by hand — e.g. in Careportal, right after physically inserting the sensor and before
 * pairing it in the app?
 *
 * Without this, a sensor inserted hours before pairing always got dated at the pairing moment:
 * [OnePlusSensorStore.startSessionForSensor] and `saveSessionStartIfAbsent` only ever saw
 * `System.currentTimeMillis()` / the first reading's timestamp, so a manual, earlier, more
 * accurate entry was silently outrun by the later auto one becoming "the most recent SENSOR_CHANGE"
 * that [app.aaps.plugins.calibration.LinearCalibrationPlugin] reads.
