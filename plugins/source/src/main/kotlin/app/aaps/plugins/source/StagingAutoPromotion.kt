/**
 * Decides when a pre-soak sensor may take over the loop by itself, without the user pressing the
 * promote button.
 *
 * Shared by the Dexcom ONE+ / G7 and the Libre 3 plugins. It is checked on every reading of the
 * pre-soak sensor, so it needs no timer, it survives an app restart, and a sensor that sends nothing
 * is never switched to.
 *
 * It only says "yes" or "not yet". The switch itself is the same function the button calls, with
 * all of its own checks. This class adds checks on top of them, it never removes one.
