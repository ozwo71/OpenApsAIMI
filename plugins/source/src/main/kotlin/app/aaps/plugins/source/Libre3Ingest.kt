/**
 * Pure gate and mapping helpers for Libre 3 to [GV] ingest. Kept beside `Libre3NativePlugin` so
 * later UI work stays out of the insert path.
 *
 * Two gates guard the loop, and they are on purpose in two different places:
 *
 * - The driver decides whether a reading is **usable at all**, because only it can see the sensor
 *   state, the data quality mark and the sensor life.
 * - This object decides whether a usable reading is **new**, and refuses anything outside the
 *   range that a sensor is allowed to report. That second check is a safety net: a mistake
 *   anywhere upstream must not be able to put a nonsense number into the loop.
