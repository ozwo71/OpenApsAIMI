/**
 * Budget for Bluetooth scan starts, shared by every Libre 3 slot in this process.
 *
 * Android allows about five `startScan` calls per thirty seconds per app. Over that, the platform
 * fails in silence: `startScan` still reports success and the callback simply never reports a
 * device. The symptom looks exactly like a sensor out of range, so a driver that keeps trying makes
 * it worse instead of better.
 *
 * One session opens with a twenty second scan, and two slots that both retry after three seconds
 * can reach about twenty starts in thirty seconds, four times over the quota. So the starts are
 * counted here and a start that has no room waits instead.
 *
 * [MAX_SCAN_STARTS] is four and not five, so one start per window is left for the rest of AAPS.
 *
 * ⚠️ ASYNC IMPACT: every method is synchronized and none of them waits. The caller decides whether
 * it may sleep, and only the slot's own Bluetooth thread ever does.
