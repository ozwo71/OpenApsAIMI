/**
 * Gives the physical sensor an owner.
 *
 * The pre-soak separates everything that can be separated — preferences file, executor, driver
 * instance — and the one thing it cannot separate is the sensor itself. Two drivers on one Libre 3
 * means two `BluetoothGatt` clients over a single link, both subscribed to the same characteristics,
 * so each receives the other's notifications and the sensor sees one interleaved stream of two
 * pairings. Neither side finishes.
 *
 * Why a process wide claim and not only a check on the Start screen: the Start screen is not the
 * only way in. The plugin resumes **both** slots on every start with no UI involved, so an install
 * whose two files already hold one sensor would reproduce the collision on every launch. A claim
 * taken where the link is really opened covers those paths, and the ones not written yet.
 *
 * ⚠️ The owner token must **not** be the driver's slot name. `Libre3CgmDriverReal` keeps its slot
 * name for the whole life of the instance, on purpose, so a bug report stays readable across a
 * promotion — a promoted instance is production but still calls itself "presoak". Keying the map on
 * that name would let the next pre-soak take over the promoted instance's claim, and the invariant
 * would break after the very first promotion. Each driver instance passes a token of its own
 * instead.
 *
 * An owner may re-claim what it already holds: reconnects and repairs inside one slot are normal,
 * and claiming a different sensor releases the owner's previous claim.
