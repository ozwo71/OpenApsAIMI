 * Loads the fixed byte tables that ship with the app.

 * assets. That choice is deliberate: a classpath resource can also be read by a plain unit test,
 * so the tables can be checked against the published vectors without a device.
 *
 * All of these files come from the MIT LibreCRKit tree. See `plugins/libre3/NOTICE` and
 * `docs/LIBRE3_NATIVE_LICENCE_MEMO.md` for where each one comes from.
