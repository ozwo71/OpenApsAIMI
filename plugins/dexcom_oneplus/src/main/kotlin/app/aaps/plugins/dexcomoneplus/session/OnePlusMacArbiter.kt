/**
 * Gives the physical sensor an owner.
 *
 * The dual-slot design separates everything that can be separated — store namespace, executor,
 * driver instance — and the one thing it cannot separate is the transmitter itself. Two slots on one
 * MAC means two `BluetoothGatt` clients over a single ACL link, both subscribed to the same Auth and
 * ExtraData characteristics, so each receives the other's notifications and the sensor sees one
 * interleaved stream of two KEKS handshakes. The field log of 2026-08-25 shows both sides dying
 * inside libkeks 1.6 s after the second connect, on a handshake that had just reported
 * `authenticated=1`. It is not a race that sometimes bites; it is certain.
 *
 * Why a process-wide claim and not only a check at the two UI entry points: the entry points are not
 * the only way in. `resumeStoredSession` runs for both slots on every plugin start, and for an
 * install whose two stores already hold the same MAC — the state a phone is left in by the very bug
 * above — that reproduced the collision on every launch with no UI involved. A claim taken where the
 * connection is actually made covers those paths, and the ones not written yet.
 *
 * An owner may re-claim what it already holds: reconnects and repairs inside one slot are normal, and
 * claiming a different MAC releases the owner's previous claim.
 *
 * ⚠️ The owner token must **not** be the driver's slot name ("prod" / "staging"). `OnePlusCgmDriverReal`
 * keeps its slot name for the whole life of the instance, on purpose, so a bug report stays readable
 * across a promotion — a promoted instance is production but still calls itself "staging" in the log.
 * Keying the map on that name would let the next pre-soak's `claim` remove the promoted instance's own
 * claim (see the "moving to another releases the old one" rule below), silently dropping the arbiter's
 * protection on the sensor that is still feeding the loop. Each driver instance passes a token of its
 * own instead — see `OnePlusCgmDriverReal.arbiterOwner`.
