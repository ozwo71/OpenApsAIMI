/**
 * Process-wide LE scan start budget shared by **all** ONE+ slots (production + staging) and the UI
 * discovery scan.
 *
 * Android silently stops delivering results when an app starts more than
 * [MAX_STARTS_PER_WINDOW_PLATFORM] LE scans within [WINDOW_MS] (`ScanManager`
 * "app is scanning too frequently"): no `onScanFailed`, no error — the callback simply never fires.
 * A single slot waiting for an ADV restarts a bounded scan roughly every 8.25 s (~7.3 starts/min),
 * which is under the quota; **two** slots doing that concurrently (~15/min) is over it and blinds
 * both of them at once, which is exactly the failure mode the dual-instance work introduced.
 *
 * This budget keeps one slot free for the UI discovery scan, so opening the Start screen can never
 * be starved by the background waits either.
 *
 * ⚠️ ASYNC IMPACT: [waitMsFor] / [record] are synchronized and non-blocking; the *caller* decides
 * whether it may sleep (background BLE executor: yes — UI thread: never, it only [record]s).
