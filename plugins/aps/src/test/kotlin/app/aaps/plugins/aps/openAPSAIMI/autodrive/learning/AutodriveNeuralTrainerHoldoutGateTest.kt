/**
 * The trainer used to be a scheduled 24 h job that always overwrote the installed weights, whatever
 * it had fitted. On a positive class measured at 0.53 % of the production corpus, 100 epochs of
 * full-batch descent at a learning rate of 0.01 from a zero start moves the intercept about -0.45
 * out of the -5.2 it needs: the output was an intercept caught halfway, and it replaced the previous
 * one every night.
 *
 * A model now has to earn its place on data it never saw.
