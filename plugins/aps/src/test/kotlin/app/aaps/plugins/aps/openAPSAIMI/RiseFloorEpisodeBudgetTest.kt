/**
 * The aggressive-rise SMB floor is a prebolus, so it is served once per rise.
 *
 * It had no memory. It re-armed on every tick, and at a 1.6 U ceiling on 5-minute ticks that is a
 * **19 U/h floor** for as long as the rise held.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-09: 1.088 U per tick for six consecutive ticks from 14:41, while the MPC asked
 * for exactly 0.000 and the safety barrier permitted exactly 0.000. Peak IOB 16.75 U against a
 * physiological budget of 8.11. Rescue carbs were needed.
 *
 * These tests mirror the ledger in `DetermineBasalAIMI2.remainingRiseFloorBudgetU` /
 * `noteRiseFloorContribution`, which are private to a 17 000-line class.
