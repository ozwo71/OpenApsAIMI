/**
 * After `finalizeAndCapSMB` writes the tick's dose, nothing may raise it.
 *
 * `finalizeAndCapSMB` is where every cap, guard and budget converges, so it is meant to be the last
 * word. It was not. Five places wrote the final SMB, and three ran after it: the AI auditor and two
 * legacy meal-mode paths.
 *
 * The auditor is the clearest case. Its own prompt says its role is *"CONFIRM or SOFTEN only — never
 * invent a lift above Harmonia's decided SMB"*, and the code did
 * `finalResult.units = result.bolusU ?: 0.0` with no comparison against what the terminal had
 * decided. A constraint stated in documentation and absent from the code — the same shape as the
 * aggressive-rise floor, whose KDoc claims it is "always re-bounded by V3 safety" while it is not.
 *
 * These tests mirror `DetermineBasalAIMI2.applySmbUnits`, which is private to a 17 000-line class.
 *
 * ## What this does not cover
 *
 * The aggressive-rise floor feeds `finalizeAndCapSMB` as an **input**, so it sits upstream of the
 * seal and is untouched by it. Its defect is that it bypasses `ControlBarrierShield`, which is a
 * different boundary and needs the barrier's insulin model fixed first.
