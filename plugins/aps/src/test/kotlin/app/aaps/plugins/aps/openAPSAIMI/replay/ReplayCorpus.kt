/**
 * Loads replay fixtures.
 *
 * Two sources, on purpose:
 *
 * - **Bundled** (`src/test/resources/replay/`) — a few of the maintainer's own days, versioned so
 *   CI can run regression checks. Enough to answer *"did this change alter the decision stream?"*.
 * - **Local** (directory named by [ENV_LOCAL_CORPUS]) — a larger private corpus that is never
 *   committed. Needed to answer *"is this threshold right?"*, because a bundled or synthetic set
 *   only contains patterns someone already believed in. During the audit that produced these ADRs,
 *   the wider corpus contradicted the working hypothesis twice; a curated set would have agreed
 *   with it.
 *
 * Tests that only need regression use [load]. Tests that calibrate use [loadLocal] and skip
 * themselves when the private corpus is absent.
 *
 * See `docs/adr/0001-replay-harness.md`.
