/**
 * Freezes the maxSMB ladder as it behaved before it was moved out of `DetermineBasalAIMI2`.
 *
 * One fixture per branch. These tests are the proof that lifting the ladder into [MaxSmbLadder]
 * changed nothing: they were written against the old inline `when` and must stay green through the
 * move. They must also stay green after the shortAvgDelta rise fix, because that fix only opens a
 * branch that was closed here, it never closes one that was open.
