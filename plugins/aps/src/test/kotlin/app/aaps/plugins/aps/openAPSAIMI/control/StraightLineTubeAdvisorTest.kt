/**
 * The tube sets this tick's SMB ceiling, and when it answers zero the caller floors the ceiling at
 * 0.05 U — a hard SMB shutdown.
 *
 * Measured on the 2026-08-13 support package (286 decision ticks over 24 h): the tube answered zero
 * on 81 ticks, 28 % of the day. Reading the cap could not say why, because three different paths all
 * end at zero and all three looked identical in the export. These tests pin the three paths apart and
 * pin the one property the shutdown rests on: the veto is nothing more than a restatement of
 * `minPredictedBg < hypoFloor`.
