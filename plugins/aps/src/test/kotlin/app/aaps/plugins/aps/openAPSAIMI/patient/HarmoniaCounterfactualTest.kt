/**
 * Specification locks for [HarmoniaCounterfactual].
 *
 * Two of these are real locks on a **measured** defect, not just a restatement of the code:
 *
 *  - `blockedReductionKeepsTheSameProposal` writes down that 221 of the 629 refusals were refusals
 *    of a `PROTECTIVE_REDUCTION`. An over-dose guard refusing an under-dose cannot be repaired by
 *    telling Harmonia about the guard, and the counterfactual must say so instead of pretending a
 *    gain is available there.
 *  - `verdictMirrorsBasalChannelSafetyGuards` compares the mirror with the real guard call for call
 *    over the whole truth table. It is the only thing that stops the two drifting apart.
 *
 * The other two are plain specification: they state what the class must answer, and they would have
 * been green from the first line of the class.
