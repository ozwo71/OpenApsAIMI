/**
 * The safety barrier must read a sensitivity that policy cannot lower.
 *
 * `enforce` derives `lgh = -siMetabolic * bg` and permits `safeU = (-gamma*h - lfh) / lgh`. A
 * **lower** sensitivity makes `|lgh|` smaller and the permitted dose **larger**, so anything able to
 * lower that number is able to loosen the barrier.
 *
 * `estimatedSI` is exactly such a number: it descends from `pkpdRuntime.fusedIsf`, which
 * `PkPdIntegration` multiplies by an aggression term bounded [0.55, 1.08] driven by delta, UAM
 * confidence and the behaviour family. On an undeclared meal that lowers the sensitivity by up to
 * 45 %, loosening the barrier and pushing the controller the same way at the same moment. A barrier
 * that moves with the controller is not a barrier.
 *
 * ## These numbers are the production regime
 *
 * Until `InsulinActionModel` landed, `AutoDriveState.createSafe` floored `estimatedSI` at `0.1` while
 * callers pass an ISF divided by 10000 — about 0.0045. Every patient was clamped to the same
 * sensitivity and the profile ISF never reached the barrier at all. The floor is gone and the
 * coefficient was re-derived so the *effective* insulin term is unchanged at ISF 45, which is why the
 * doses below are small: the barrier really does bind here, as it did in production.
 *
 * Measured on a 17 068-row `autodrive_dataset.csv` (2026-02-28 to 2026-07-11): on the 14 291 rows
 * where the floor was active the barrier intervened on 41.2 % of ticks and zeroed the whole dose on
 * 37.7 %. That is the behaviour these tests describe.
