/**
 * Specification locks for [ObservedSensitivityMeter].
 *
 * These are **not** a red-before / green-after proof of a bug: the class is new, so every test here
 * simply writes down the rule the class must keep. The one test that documents a real mistake is
 * `a zero temp basal window credits less insulin than the raw iob drop`: without the basal integral
 * the meter would answer 20.0 instead of 31.6 on the same descent.
 *
 * ## Why the closed window is 30 minutes and not the whole descent
 *
 * The meter keeps the **shortest** window that passes every filter, and it is fed one tick at a
 * time, so a window closes at the first tick where one is valid. On a straight-line descent that is
 * 30 minutes after the start. Every descent below is a straight line, so the sensitivity is the same
 * for any sub-window of it: the ratio the meter reports is exactly the ratio computed by hand over
 * the whole fall, while the fall and the insulin of the closed window are 6/11 of the whole-descent
 * figures.
