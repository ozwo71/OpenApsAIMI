/**
 * The aggressive-rise SMB floor must stop at the ceiling the maxSMB ladder chose for the tick.
 *
 * The floor used to be capped by `max(maxSMB, maxSMBHB)`, so it took the high-BG ceiling even on
 * ticks where the ladder had refused to promote. Measured over three support packages: on 36 of 50
 * floor-active ticks the floor landed exactly on `maxSMBHB`, and on 31 of those 50 the ladder had
 * chosen a lower value.
 *
 * The fixtures below are real ticks, and each one matters for a different reason:
 *  - dinner 2026-08-14 20:41 — ladder on standard 1.60 U, floor took 2.70 U, five such ticks in a
 *    row drove IOB from 5.73 to 19.32 U and BG to 65.7 mg/dL. This is the case the change fixes.
 *  - the 10:00 meal on 2026-08-15 — ladder on standard 0.80 U, floor took 2.20 U, BG went to 64.1.
 *  - lunch 2026-08-15 13:57 — ladder had already promoted, so `maxSMB` equals `maxSMBHB` at 1.80 U
 *    and the floor is unchanged. This is the rescue the change must not break.
 *  - the 2026-08-12 crash ticks at BG 287-297 — the BG >= 250 branch promotes, so again unchanged.
 *
 * These tests mirror the clamp in `DetermineBasalAIMI2.determine_basal` around `smbCeilingForFloor`,
 * which is private to an 18 000-line class.
