/**
 * The barrier must be able to say *why* it permitted nothing.
 *
 * `cbf_permitted_u` is the dose that came out, already bounded by what the solver asked for, so a
 * zero there cannot distinguish "the solver wanted nothing" from "the barrier suspended everything".
 * On the 2026-08-14 lunch that ambiguity was read the first way and recorded in
 * `docs/AIMI_NEXT_SESSION.md` §AQ6-4 as "the controller asks for nothing at all". It was the second
 * way: the barrier was suspending the dose on every tick of the plateau.
 *
 * The state below is that plateau, 13:52 — BG 220.4, IOB 10.19, Ra 2.81, no declared carbs.
