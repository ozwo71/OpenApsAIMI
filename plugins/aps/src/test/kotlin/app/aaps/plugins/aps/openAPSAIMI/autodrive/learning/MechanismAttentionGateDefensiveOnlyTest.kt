/**
 * The attention gate may only ever make the loop **more** cautious.
 *
 * Lowering `estimatedSI` does not just push the MPC: `ControlBarrierShield` computes
 * `lgh = -siMetabolic * bg` from the same field, so a smaller sensitivity shrinks the coefficient on
 * the control action and the barrier permits a **larger** dose. An attention model that lowers SI is
 * therefore loosening a safety constraint.
 *
 * The permissive arm was `1.0 - (0.5 - score) * 0.4`, down to ×0.8. Since the classifier trains from
 * scratch on a ~3 % positive class with no feature normalisation, its fitted probability sits below
 * 0.5 almost always — so that arm would have fired on essentially every engaged tick, driven by the
 * base rate of hypoglycaemia rather than by measured resistance.
 *
 * These assertions pin the direction, not the arithmetic of the classifier.
