/**
 * The rise escape must stop at the physiological budget.
 *
 * `ESCAPE_RISE` pinned the raw multiplier at 0.88 for as long as glucose was climbing, with no regard
 * for the insulin already on board. Smoothing turns 0.88 into 0.928, which clears the `FULL` threshold
 * of 0.92, so the governor stayed wide open.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-08-09: it held `FULL` up to IOB 16.75 U against a budget of 8.11 — 2.07x — while
 * 14.09 U of SMB were delivered. The episode ended when the governor finally left `FULL`, not because
 * anything decided to stop.
 *
 * `ESCAPE_PROJECTION`, three lines below, already carried the `iobSafe < budget` guard. The omission
 * here was an oversight: a rise justifies continuing to correct, it does not justify exceeding what
 * the body can absorb.
