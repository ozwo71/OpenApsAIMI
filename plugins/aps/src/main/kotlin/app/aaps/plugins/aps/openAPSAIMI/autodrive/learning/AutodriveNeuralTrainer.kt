/**
 * 🧠 Autodrive Neural Trainer (on-device learning)
 *
 * Fits the logistic model behind [MechanismAttentionGate]: given the physiological stress mask and
 * whether Autodrive drove the tick, how likely is a hypoglycaemia in the next hour.
 *
 * ## Why the previous objective could not produce a model
 *
 * It was full-batch gradient descent, 100 epochs at a learning rate of 0.01, from a zero
 * initialisation, on a positive class measured at **0.53 %** of the production corpus (91 of 17 011
 * labelled rows). Almost the whole gradient budget goes into the intercept, which has to travel to
 * `ln(0.0053 / 0.9947) ≈ -5.2`; after 100 epochs it has moved about -0.45. The output was neither
 * fitted nor calibrated — it was an intercept caught halfway.
 *
 * Three things changed, and no more than three:
 *
 * 1. **Class-balanced loss.** Each class contributes the same total weight, so the fit is about the
 *    features rather than about the base rate.
 * 2. **Prior correction on save.** Balancing calibrates the output to a 50 % prior; left there, the
 *    gate's `score > 0.5` test would fire on roughly half of all ticks — a systematic sensitivity
 *    inflation dressed up as a detection. The intercept is shifted back onto the true base rate
 *    before the weights are written, so a score above 0.5 keeps meaning "more likely than not".
 * 3. **A chronological holdout gate.** The last [HOLDOUT_FRACTION] of the corpus by time is never
 *    trained on. The new model replaces the incumbent only if it beats **both** the incumbent and a
 *    base-rate-only predictor on that holdout, by [MIN_IMPROVEMENT]. Otherwise the incumbent stays.
 *
 * Features are already bounded in [0, 1] by construction — the mask entries are confidences and
 * `Engaged` is an indicator — so there is nothing to normalise. Measured on the corpus: mask ranges
 * were [0, 1.000], [0, 0.963], [0, 0.990].
 *
 * ## Rows this refuses to learn from
 *
 * Rows written before schema [VERSION_CGM_LABELLED] carry an outcome label produced by the old
 * CSV-based pass, which gave up at the first coverage gap and wrote `0`. They also have no `Engaged`
 * field. Reading a missing field as `1.0`, as this class used to, made `Engaged` a perfect proxy for
 * "labelled by the broken method" — the model would have fitted a weight to the labelling bug. Those
 * rows are skipped here and re-derived by [AutodriveDataBackfiller].
