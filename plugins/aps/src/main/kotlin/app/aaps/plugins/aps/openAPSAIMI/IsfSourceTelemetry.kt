package app.aaps.plugins.aps.openAPSAIMI

/**
 * Diagnostic-only side channel that records **which sensitivity source** the last
 * `OpenAPSAIMIPlugin.getIsfMgdl` call actually returned.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `getIsfMgdl` returns a bare `Double?`, and a `null` makes `ProfileSealed.getIsfMgdl` fall back to
 * the static profile ISF — a different quantity, chosen silently. The cached branch can also return
 * a value computed for an earlier tick, because the recomputation runs on a background scope. From
 * a support package it was impossible to tell which of the three happened, so a value moving by a
 * factor of ten between two consecutive ticks could not be explained.
 *
 * This object makes the choice observable. It is written on every call and read once per tick when
 * the decision snapshot is assembled. It never feeds a dose calculation.
 *
 * See `docs/adr/0003-dynisf-cache-read-path.md`.
