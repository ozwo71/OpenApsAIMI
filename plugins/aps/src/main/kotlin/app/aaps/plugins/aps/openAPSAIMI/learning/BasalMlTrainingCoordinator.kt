 * The one place the basal / T3C label window is written down.
 *
 * The trainer clamps every label into this window, so a model can only have LEARNED a value inside it;
 * anything it asks for outside is extrapolation. `BasalNeuralLearner` therefore uses the same numbers as
 * its runtime clamp, and the two used to be two copies of the same literals with only a KDoc pointer
 * between them. They live here now so they cannot drift apart quietly, and
 * `BasalMlTrainingCoordinatorTest` fails if the runtime clamp stops matching.
 *
 * The basal FLOOR is the deliberate exception: the runtime floor is 0.80, strictly BELOW [BASAL_MIN].
 * That gap is load-bearing. When the label floor and the runtime floor are the same number, a saturated
 * label and a dead model produce the exact same multiplier, and that is what hid a constant model for 40
 * days in the field (raw output 0.19918, reported as 0.70 by the clamp). Do not close it.
