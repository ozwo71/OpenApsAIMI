/**
 * Sensor-driven effort / activity belief.
 *
 * Fuses multi-window steps (5 / 15 / 60 min), heart-rate elevation, HRV depression and a stress
 * signal into a graded, **signed** posture ([Posture]) plus an effort-load **memory** that keeps the
 * protection alive after the activity ends (post-exercise insulin sensitivity lasts hours, whereas a
 * 15-min step window collapses in minutes).
 *
 * Key design points:
 *  - **Reduction-only output** ([Assessment.smbFactor] / [Assessment.basalFactor] are ≤ 1.0) — the
 *    insulin side can only be *lowered*; fail-safe direction.
 *  - **Exertion vs stress disambiguation**: HRV depression + HR elevation are common to both, but they
 *    pull insulin opposite ways (exercise → ↑sensitivity → less insulin; acute stress → ↑resistance).
 *    Steps disambiguate: movement ⇒ exertion (protect); HR↑ + HRV↓ + stress prob but no movement ⇒
 *    stress (do **not** reduce insulin).
 *  - **Onset is fast, memory is slow**: the 5-min window may open the *current* [State.ACTIVE]
 *    reduction on its own (we must not react late to real exercise), but it may **not** arm the
 *    cross-tick memory. Arming needs the 15-min window to show real movement, otherwise a single
 *    step burst (a walk to the kitchen) restarts hours of protection while the user sits still.
 *  - **Protection length follows the effort length**: the recent-effort horizon grows with how long
 *    the corroborated effort lasted, from [EFFORT_MEMORY_BASE_MIN] up to [EFFORT_MEMORY_MAX_MIN].
 *    A short walk gets short protection; a long session gets the full window.
 *  - **Pure & deterministic**: no clocks, no I/O. The caller owns [Memory] across ticks and passes
 *    `nowMs` in. This makes the whole branch unit-testable.
