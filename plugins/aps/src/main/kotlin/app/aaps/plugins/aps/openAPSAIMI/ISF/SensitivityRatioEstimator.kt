/**
 * Estimates **how strongly insulin actually acts for this patient**, as a dimensionless ratio on the
 * profile ISF.
 *
 * ## Why a ratio, and why from outcomes
 *
 * The commanded sensitivity is today a stack of ten stages — a BG staircase, a delta correction, two
 * disagreeing fast estimators combined by a maximum, a slow floor, three rate limiters and a cache —
 * and only 18 % of its movement is explained by the variables it is supposed to depend on. It is not
 * an estimate of anything; it is a dosing policy wearing the name of a physiological parameter.
 *
 * This estimator answers one question and nothing else: *given what was delivered, how much did
 * glucose actually fall?* It observes **closed windows** where the answer is readable — nothing
 * being digested, no bolus of any origin, a decaying IOB, glucose going down — and folds each
 * observation into a slow state.
 *
 * The result is a ratio, not an ISF, so it composes: `S = profileIsf × ratio`. The circadian shape
 * stays owned by the user's profile blocks, which is where it belongs.
 *
 * ## What "closed" has to mean
 *
 * A window that is merely free of AIMI's own SMBs is not closed. A meal bolus is a bolus, and the
 * carbs it covers are still being absorbed: the absorption offsets part of the fall, so the drop
 * credited to insulin is **too small**, so the measured ratio is **too low**, so the sensitivity
 * commanded from it is too low, so the loop gives **more** insulin. That is the dangerous direction,
 * on the quantity proposed to replace the commanded sensitivity. So a window is rejected outright if
 * it — or its run-up — contains any carbs on board, any bolus of any origin, or any SMB.
 *
 * ## The basal deficit correction
 *
 * `iobU` is net of profile basal. When the loop runs a zero temp basal, IOB decays partly because
 * insulin acted and partly because insulin was **not given** — and the second part lowers nothing.
 * Ignoring it made the same production data read 9.7 mg/dL/U instead of 11.9. The deficit is
 * subtracted from the insulin credited with the fall, and it is computed from the basal that was
 * **delivered**, which is the running temp basal, not the rate the loop is about to ask for.
 *
 * ## Why the state is persisted
 *
 * Roughly 52 observations are needed to move the ratio from 1.0 to 0.94. Android kills the process
 * routinely, and an in-memory ratio restarts at 1.0 every time — so in the field it would never
 * converge, and every export would show a value that had merely not had time to move. The ratio,
 * the observation count and the time of the last fold are written to disk and reloaded, with a
 * staleness rule: state older than [STALE_AFTER_DAYS] days describes a patient who may have changed,
 * so it is discarded rather than trusted.
 *
 * ## What it is not
 *
 * It cannot separate a meal from a drop in sensitivity within a single episode — measured on
 * 2026-08-04, a real meal and the fat tail of an earlier one were indistinguishable on BG, delta,
 * IOB and IOB slope. That is why observations are only taken in windows where nothing is being
 * digested, and why the state moves over hours, not minutes.
 *
 * See `docs/adr/0008-isf-decision-architecture.md`.
