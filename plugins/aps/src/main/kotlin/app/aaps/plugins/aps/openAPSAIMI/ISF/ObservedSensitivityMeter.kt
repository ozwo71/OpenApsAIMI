/**
 * Measures the insulin sensitivity that the **outcomes** imply, as `-dBG / insulin absorbed` over
 * clean falls. It is an instrument, not a controller.
 *
 * ## What the number is worth, and what it is not worth
 *
 * Endogenous glucose production is **not** modelled. The liver keeps releasing glucose while the
 * glucose falls, so part of the insulin that was absorbed paid for that release instead of moving
 * the measured glucose down. The measured number is therefore a **lower bound** on the true
 * sensitivity — but only under one condition: the profile basal must not be too high. The window
 * credits the insulin above the profile basal, so if the profile basal itself is too high, the
 * excess insulin it carries is never counted as a cost while its effect is still counted as a fall.
 * The number then reads **too high**, not too low. Read it next to `command_isf_mgdl`, and read the
 * two together, never one alone.
 *
 * There is no carbohydrate model, no meal model and no exercise model here. Windows with carbs on
 * board, or with a meal in the run-up, or with a measurable rate of glucose appearance, are simply
 * refused. The class prefers to answer nothing rather than to answer with a guess.
 *
 * ## Strictly passive
 *
 * Nothing in the dosing chain may read this. To check that, run:
 *
 * ```
 * grep -rn "ObservedSensitivityMeter\|isf_obs_" plugins/aps/src/main/kotlin/
 * ```
 *
 * It must return exactly four zones and nothing else:
 *  1. this class,
 *  2. the import and the field declaration in `DetermineBasalAIMI2`,
 *  3. the one feeding block in `runAimiSnapshotMedicalJsonAndHormonitorExportStage`,
 *  4. the `BaselineState` field declarations and their `put` lines in `toMedicalJson`.
 *
 * Any other line is a violation: it would mean a dose depends on a passive instrument.
 *
 * ## Where the filters come from
 *
 * The thresholds are the ones the offline corpus study used, and they are written down in
 * [DynamicSensitivityPolicy]: at least 30 minutes, at least a 25 mg/dL fall, no carbs on board,
 * a mean rate of appearance below 0.30 mg/dL/min, and at least 0.8 U absorbed. Here they are
 * applied continuously, tick after tick, inside the app, so the same rule that produced the offline
 * table also runs live.
 *
 * The appearance-rate filter is **fail-closed**: a window in which the rate of appearance was never
 * known is refused, not accepted. An unverifiable filter is not a passed filter.
 *
 * ## No persistence
 *
 * Windows live in memory only. A process restart empties them, and this is a deliberate choice: the
 * measure is cheap to rebuild and a stale file would be worse than an empty one. `isf_obs_window_count`
 * is the witness — when it is small or zero, the medians simply have not been rebuilt yet.
 *
 * @param windowRetentionMs how long a closed window is kept.
 * @param maxWindows hard cap on the number of kept windows.
