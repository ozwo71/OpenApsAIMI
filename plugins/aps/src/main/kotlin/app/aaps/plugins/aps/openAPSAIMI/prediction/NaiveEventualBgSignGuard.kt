/**
 * PR_NegativeIobEbgInflation: when AAPS [iobUnits] drifts negative, the legacy formula
 * `bg - iob * sens` inverts sign and inflates naive eventual BG.  Two collapse paths:
 *
 * 1. **Peak-activity path** (original): fires when PKPD reports ≥ [MIN_PKPD_RELATIVE_ACTIVITY]
 *    and stage is PEAK/RISING — structural disagreement between the bilinear IOB model and PKPD.
 *
 * 2. **Post-hypo path** (added): fires when [minBgLookback75mMgdl] < [POST_HYPO_BG_THRESHOLD].
 *    The negative-IOB artifact is most pronounced exactly when PKPD activity is LOW (TAIL/EXHAUSTED,
 *    ~1–4 %) after a recent hypo, and the guard's peak-activity precondition is false — so path 1
 *    cannot fire even though the sign-flip is real and inflates the eventual to 300+ mg/dL.
 *    In this window, collapsing naive eventual to `bg` is always safer than letting the inflate stand.
 *
 * Rounding matches [app.aaps.plugins.aps.openAPSAIMI.DetermineBasalAIMI2.round] with digits = 0 (nearest long).
