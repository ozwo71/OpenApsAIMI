     * [profileIsf] is the profile ISF in mg/dL/U; the state carries sensitivity as ISF/10000, so it is
     * rescaled. The result is `max(profile-anchored, commanded)` because a **higher** sensitivity
     * makes `lgh = -siMetabolic * bg` larger in magnitude and the permitted dose smaller. Taking the
     * maximum means:
     *
     * - a policy multiplier that lowers the commanded sensitivity no longer loosens the barrier;
     * - a defensive learner that raises it is still honoured;
     * - the barrier can never end up looser than it is today, whatever the inputs.
     *
     * On a non-finite or non-positive profile ISF there is no anchor to trust, so the commanded value
     * is used unchanged and the event is logged rather than silently substituted.

     * unfloored coefficient is 0.67x and the barrier would be about a third more permissive.

     * A third more permissive **on the median tick** is not something to ship on arithmetic. So the

     * pure apart from its acceleration memory, and that memory is now keyed on [observationId], so the
