 * Single owner of the learned PK/PD state for the whole process.
 *
 * Two `@Singleton` consumers build their own [PkPdIntegration]: the loop plugin, which only reads
 * the learned kinetics, and the AIMI determine-basal engine, which is the only one allowed to
 * learn. Without a shared owner the reader keeps the values it read at start up for ever, so the
 * prediction kinetics never follow what the learner found.
 *
 * Only the learned state is shared. Everything else stays per consumer on purpose:
 * - the ISF fusion holds a per call slew limiter, so sharing it would let the dosing ISF move
 *   about three times faster per loop tick;
 * - the recent bolus samples change `pkpdScale`, so sharing them would change the ISF that doses.
