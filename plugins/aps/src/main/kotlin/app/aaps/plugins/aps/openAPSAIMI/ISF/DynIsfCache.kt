/**
 * Small time-keyed store for the dynamic ISF values the loop computes.
 *
 * ## Why the key is only a time
 *
 * The store this class replaces was keyed on `bucketStart + glucose`, and it read the newest value
 * as "the last key". Keys are kept sorted, so that read returned the entry of the **highest glucose
 * of the newest bucket**, not the most recent entry. While glucose was falling, the value stayed
 * pinned to the one computed at the peak of the bucket. A time and a glucose must never be added
 * into one scalar that is then used for ordering.
 *
 * Here the key is the start of the time bucket only, so "last key" means "most recent". The exact
 * sample time is kept inside [Sample], so the age of a value is measured from when it was written,
 * not from the start of its bucket. The glucose it was computed for is kept as plain data and never
 * takes part in ordering.
 *
 * Writes are ordered, not "last writer wins": inside one bucket, an older write never replaces a
 * newer one. Two writers really do aim at the same bucket out of order at start up.
 *
 * Old entries are dropped one by one when they fall out of the retention window. The store is never
 * emptied in one go: a wholesale `clear()` made the very next read fall back to the static profile
 * ISF, which is a different quantity.
 *
 * This class is plain Kotlin on purpose. It uses no Android collection, so it can be unit tested
 * on the JVM.
 *
 * See `docs/adr/0003-dynisf-cache-read-path.md`.
 *
 * @param bucketMs width of one time bucket. Two writes inside the same bucket share a key, so the
 *   later one replaces the earlier one.
 * @param retentionMs how long a sample is kept before it is evicted.
