/**
 * Mirror of the basal-first safety verdict, as Harmonia would see it **if it were told**.
 *
 * Harmonia is asked for a plan long before the tick knows whether the SMB channel was zeroed for
 * safety. The verdict is posted later, and the guard reads it later still. Harmonia therefore never
 * learns the rule it is judged on, and never learns that it was refused.
 *
 * This class is that missing message, written down once so it can be measured. It is
 * **strictly passive**: nothing in the dosing chain reads it, and the field
 * [wouldBlockBasalFirst] is only a copy of the real rule, never the rule itself.
 *
 * The copy must stay identical to
 * [app.aaps.plugins.aps.openAPSAIMI.basal.BasalChannelSafetyGuards.shouldBlockBasalFirst].
 * `HarmoniaCounterfactualTest.verdictMirrorsBasalChannelSafetyGuards` compares the two call for
 * call over the full truth table, so a change on one side and not the other fails the build.
 *
 * @param criticalSafetyZeroed a safety rule zeroed the SMB of this tick.
 * @param contextSuppressSmb the active context suppresses the SMB of this tick.
 * @param mealModeActive a manual meal mode is declared, which exempts the channel from the guard.
 * @param guardsEnabled the guard preference is on. When off, the guard blocks nothing.
