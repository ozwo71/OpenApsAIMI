/**
 * Small in-memory queue that holds SMB training rows until their outcome can be observed.
 *
 * Why it exists: the SMB model is trained on the `smbGiven` column, which is the dose that was
 * really delivered. That column says nothing about **where** the dose came from, and nothing about
 * what happened next. Measured on 26 days, about four units in ten leave with the model output at
 * zero, so the model learns to copy the safety net roughly one time in two.
 *
 * This class does not change the label, the training filter or the model input vector. It only
 * carries four origin fields plus one delayed outcome field to the end of each CSV row, so the
 * question can be answered offline.
 *
 * Two things happen with a delay, so a row cannot be written at the moment it is built:
 *  - the origin fields are only complete at the end of the tick, when the binding trace is built;
 *  - the realised glucose is only known about half an hour later.
 *
 * The row therefore waits here and is written once its outcome window has passed. A row whose
 * outcome never arrives inside the window is still written, but with an **empty** outcome field:
 * an empty field must never be read as a value, and a stale reading must never be written as if it
 * were the outcome. This mirrors `BasalNeuralLearner.fillRealisedOutcomes`, which leaves a sample
 * unrealised rather than labelling it with an old value.
