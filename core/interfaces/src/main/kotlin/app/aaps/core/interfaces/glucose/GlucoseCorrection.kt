 * One place that turns a **stored** sensor reading into the value the app really shows.

 * Calibration and smoothing are applied to the in-memory bucketed series only
 * ([app.aaps.core.interfaces.aps.AutosensDataStore.getBucketedDataTableCopy]); the stored
 * [app.aaps.core.data.model.GV] keeps the plain sensor value for ever. So everything that reads the
 * database directly - the local glucose alarms, the Nightscout upload, the xDrip broadcast - used to
 * show a different number than the dashboard, the widget, the watch and the loop.
 *
 * This maps a stored reading onto the corrected series, so all of them show one value.
