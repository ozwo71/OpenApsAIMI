/**
 * Publishes part of the Custom watch face as an image complication.
 *
 * This is the bridge for watches whose firmware no longer selects or binds code-based watch faces
 * (Galaxy Watch 7 and later). There a Watch Face Format document is the only face that can run, and
 * a complication is the only channel from AAPS into it. So the CWF keeps being drawn by our own
 * code - honouring the user's zip, its dynamic values and its `dynPref` cascade - and the result is
 * handed over as a picture for the document to display.
 *
 * Subclasses differ only in [block]. Splitting the face lets the two halves refresh at different
 * rates: the lower half carries the background, the images and the chart and changes slowly, while
 * the upper half carries the clock and the hands and has to keep up with the second. Measurements
 * behind that split are in `_docs/CWF_WFF_Prompt.md`.
 *
 * Limits inherent to the approach, documented there rather than worked around here: the picture only
 * changes when the system asks for an update, and the user's own complication slots are not part of
 * it, because complication data only ever reaches the watch face the system has bound.
