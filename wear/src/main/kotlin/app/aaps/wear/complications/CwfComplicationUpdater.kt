/**
 * Asks the system to refresh the Custom watch face image complications when the picture has actually
 * changed, instead of waiting for the periodic timer.
 *
 * `UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS` is documented as a wish and was measured being honoured only every 1.5 to
 * 6 minutes, which is far too slow for a watch face. A data source may also **push**, and a push was
 * measured being delivered in **15 to 115 ms** - effectively immediately, and not throttled. So the
 * cadence is ours to choose; see `_docs/CWF_WFF_Prompt.md`.
 *
 * Three triggers, each matching something that genuinely changes the picture:
 *
 * - **the clock**, on a timer, refreshing only the upper half - the half that carries the time;
 * - **new data** from the phone, refreshing both halves;
 * - **a preference change**, refreshing both halves at once, because a preference can change the
 *   layout itself and the user is looking at the watch when they change one.
 *
 * Lives for the life of the process rather than of a service: a data source is bound only for as
 * long as it takes to answer one request, so nothing inside one can drive a schedule.
